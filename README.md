## Deployment

The implementation of ESim relies on two external packages: [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). We use Ubuntu as an example for the deployment.

First, let's install the GSL.
```
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
```
Second, we will download Eigen and build the binaries for ESim using Makefile.
```
make
```
In the end, the binaries are in the folder bin/.

## Default Run

The default run will download a bibliographic network (dblp_data) from our data mining group server.
```
./run.sh
```

After ESim generates the embedding vectors, users may use the search script to do similarity search. The usage is similar to the similar word search in word2vec.
```
./search.sh
```

## Input Formats
ESim takes three files as input for training, which are the node file, link file and meta-path file.
#### Node File
The node file contains the nodes in the training network. Each line of the file describes the name (a string) and the type (a char) of a node, which are separated by space. An example is presented below:
```
Jiawei_Han a
PathSim p
KDD v
...
```

#### Link File
The link file contains the links between different nodes. Each line of the file describes the head node and the end node of a link, which are separated by space. An example is presented below:
```
Jiawei_Han PathSim
PathSim Jiawei_Han
PathSim KDD
KDD PathSim
...
```

#### Meta-path File
The meta-path file contains the meta-paths used for training. Users can specify multiple meta-paths, and each line describes a meta-path and its relative weight. An example is presented below:
```
apa 0.3
apvpa 0.7
...
```

## Example Output
Below is the example output on the DBLP dataset with the query as "Jiawei_Han" and the meta-path as "apvpa".
